# VBA_projects

VBA modules designed to improve productivity in Excel.

The first module, MatchArrays, has similar functionality to the VLOOKUP or MATCH functions.
Benefits to include:
  Faster than VLOOKUP or MATCH on thousands of rows (done)
  Simpler user experience (halfway there, work-in-progress)
  Simpler usage in VBA than writing new functions (work-in-progress)
  Quick-Access Toolbar button to run (may be programmatically added or packaged with instructions)

Requirements:
  Microsoft Excel 2010 or greater (Untested in older version)
  Microsoft Scripting Runtime reference (instructions to be included in package)
